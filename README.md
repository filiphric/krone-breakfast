# Ease your journey into test automation with Cypress Studio

Demo repository for my talk on GeoSTQB Testerâ€™s day 2021.

In this repo you will find the final code from my talk as well as the application I am testing.

Before you start, open your terminal and type:

```
npm install
```
This will install Cypress as well as the Trello application.

To run the application, type:
```
npm start
```

To open Cypress, open a new terminal and type:
```
npx cypress open
```

## Enjoy!
